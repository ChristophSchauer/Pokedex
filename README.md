I am humbled by the reaction to my project, it's been a lot of fun to work on. There's more to come...

Good news! I'm currently working on machining the molds to resin cast pokedex cases! They will be stronger and cheaper than 3D printed cases and hopefully I'll be able to produce them in a variety of colors for a variety of models and team insignia! Keep an eye here for updates.

##Update 7/14/2016

Hey all, I've had requests for iPhone6S compatible cases. I'm testing a model right now! I've also had requests for more filetypes that might be compatible with more modeling software, I'll get as many up as I can. 

Be warned! I've just discovered that some of these files are mirrored and I haven't had a chance to fix them. 

Some people have asked if they can buy one from me, I'm currently exploring the options and testing models for several popular phones but they take some time to print so it will be a few days before I'm happy with them. In the event that I work out a way to sell finished Pokédex cases, I'll put the link here. 

Thanks for your patience, new models are coming tomorrow!
